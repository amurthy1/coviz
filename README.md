# Visualizing US Covid trends by State/County

There are many great visualizations that show the current number of Covid-19 cases in each US county
(e.g. [Johnâ€™s Hopkins](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html), [NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html)).
But none that I could find show the trend over time in each region.

This project plots the number of cases over time broken down at the US county level and at the state level.
